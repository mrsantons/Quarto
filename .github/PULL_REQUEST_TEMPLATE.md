**LINKED ISSUE**

_[Whenver possible, a pull request should address a pre-existing issue. 
That issue can be linked to the pull request by using the side panel in the Github UI or 
using the `#` symbol followed by the number of the associated issue]_

**DESCRIPTION**

_[A pull request description describes what constitutes the Pull Request and what changes you have made to the code.
It explains what you've done, including any code changes, configuration changes, migrations included, new APIs introduced, 
changes made to old APIs, any new workers/crons introduced in the system, copy changes, and so on. You get the gist.]_

You should include this section because it gives a glimpse to different stakeholders into what the PR is doing.
For a non-technical person, the description should explain what the impact will be on the system when these code changes are deployed to production.
It will also help the reviewer in understanding what they will be reviewing (kind of a prologue/trailer).
And finally it helps QA/SDET in understanding the scope of the PR as well.
So the "what" of the PR should give a glimpse into what constitutes the changes in the PR.

**METHODOLOGY**

_[This section explains why the above changes explained were done.
Sometimes a developer feels that it's okay to write "Business/Product requirement" in the description. That's fine, but doing so defeats the purpose of this section.
If there is a better explanation as to why the changes were suggested, it's always good to attach a document reference link for that information.
A good "Why" section should explain the reasoning behind any changes.]_

This PR was modeled after the information given in [this](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-write-a-pull-request-description/) article by Sajal Sharma.
